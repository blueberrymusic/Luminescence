<h1>Andrew's Digital Loom Help <small>Improved and Online!</small> </h1>


<p>
This is a quick-start guide to my online
<a href="http://www.TK">Digital Loom</a>.
</p>

<p>
The Digital Loom is a simplified and abstracted version
of a real loom used for weaving cloth.
You can set up the loom using patterns published in weaving
books that are over 100 years old,
or you can cook up crazy new designs of your own.
</p>

<p>
This document moves quickly.
For more information on everything, 
take a look at the 
<a href="#furtherReading">Further Reading</a>
section.
</p>

<p><a name='quickStart'></a></p>
<h2>Super-Quick Start</h2>
<p>
Click on the <em>Load Draft</em> button
near the top-middle of the screen and 
take a look at the built-in presets.
Don't bother clicking on the grids or
the fabric on the right,
because they're not interactive.
Instead, you can change the fabric size
using the text box above the fabric,
or change the pattern of the fabric
by altering what's in any of the five text boxes
on the left (and then pressing the arrow
to that box's right).
Start by changing colors (you can probably
guess at some reasonable color names for now),
and try fiddling with some of the numbers.
For now, keep all of your numbers in the range 0 to 7,
but you'll probably still get crazy results!
In the sections below you'll come to know
everything that's going on here.

<h2>Overview of The Digital Loom</h2>

</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Figure 1 shows the Digital Loom,
with the major components labeled.
To create a piece of woven fabric,
you type expressions in the AWL language
(described below) into the five input
boxes on the left.
After you've typed an expression in one of
the boxes,
press the arrow to its right to copy the
results onto the right side of the window.
</p>

<p>
In this document I'll use very casual language
for the loom and its components;
see the references in the
<a href="#furtherReading">Further Reading</a>
section for more careful descriptions of the 
loom's elements and their names.
</p>

<h2>The Right Side: The Draft</h2>

<p>
The right side of the window is 
collectively called the <strong>draft</strong>.
This shows you the results of your AWL
expressions,
and the final fabric that results.
The fabric is automatically re-woven each
time you change one of the input expressions.
The draft is not interactive:
clicking on the draft and fabric has no effect.
</p>
<p>
Think of the fabric as a grid.
We want to know the color of each cell
in that grid.
To find it,
we look at the three checkerboards
below and to the right of the grid,
and the row and column of colors 
just outside them.
</p>
<p>
The checkerboard on the right is
called the <strong>weft</strong>.
Each row of the weft is white except for
exactly one black square.
To the right of the weft is a column
of colors,
collectively called the <strong>weft colors</strong>.
Imagine that each cell in the weft colors
array is the source of a thread of colored
yarn that runs to the left pefectly horizontally,
passing through each cell of the fabric to its left.
</p>
<p>
The checkerboard below the fabric
called the <strong>warp</strong>.
Each column of the warp is white except for
exactly one black square.
Below the warp is a row
of colors,
collectively called the <strong>warp colors</strong>.
Imagine that each cell in the warp colors
array is the source of a thread of colored
yarn that runs vertically upwards,
passing through each cell of the fabric above it.
</p>
<p>
Thus each cell in the fabric has two threads
passing through it.
One of these threads will be on top, while
the other passes under it.
The cell will have the color of the thread on top.
To determine which thread is on top,
we use one more checkerboard.
</p>
<p>
The checkerboard below and to the right of
the fabric is called the <strong>tie-up</strong>.
Unlike the warp and weft,
the tie-up can have any arrangement of white
and black cells
(it can even be all white or all black,
though that would make a pretty boring fabric).
</p>
<p>
To determine which thread is on top of any given
cell in the fabric,
we follow a simple process,
illustrated in Figure 2:
</p>

<figure class="figure ">
  <img src="http://placehold.it/600x400" class="img-rounded center-block" alt="A generic square placeholder image with rounded corners in a figure.">
  <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">
Figure 2: Finding the color of a cell in the fabric.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<ol>
<li>Look directly to the right, and find the black
cell in the weft for this row.</li>
<li>Look directly below, and find the black cell
in the warp for this column.</li>
<li>Look below the black weft cell, and to the
right of the black warp cell, to find a cell
in the tie-up. If that cell is black, the
warp thread is on top. Otherwise, the weft 
thread is on top.
</ol>

<p>
Although it's easy to state,
understanding how the warp, weft, and tie-up interact
to produce a design is anything but obvious!
You'll find that as you experiment with these three grids,
your intuition will grow,
and you'll get better at predicting what a particular
type of change will do to your design.
But part of the pleasure of having a digital loom at your
disposal is that it's easy to experiment,
and experiment again!
Just play and have fun,
and see what you can discover.
</p>
<p>
But if you can't click on the draft,
how do you set it up?
The answer is that the draft is created as a result
of the expressions you type into the input boxes
on the left hand side;
we'll turn to those now.
</p>

<h2>The Bridge: Patterns</h2>

<p>
The trick to describing a draft is to 
fill in the black and white squares the
way you want.
The historical way to to do this is to
use patterns of numbers.
We use this tradition here, 
as it allows you to immediately use any
of the countless drafts that have been
collected and published,
and it lets you communicate with other weavers.
</p>

<p>
Each of the five elements of the draft
gets filled in with its own pattern.
The three checkerboards use lists of numbers,
while the two colors sources use lists
of colors.
Each of these five grids has a slightly
different rule for how you convert its list
to grid contents,
so we'll cover each one.
In all cases,
we start counting at 0.
</p>

<p>
First, the weft: the checkerboard immediately
to the right of the fabric.
As we saw above,
the weaving process depends on
each row of the weft having exactly one black square.
So we can describe the weft by simply identifying
the location of that square in each row.
We do this by starting at the <strong>bottom</strong>
of the weft checkerboard,
and working our way up.
As we read each number from our list,
we count starting at the <strong>left</strong>
and going right.
Look at the weft grid in Figure 3a.
If the leftmost cell is black, we'd write 
that as 0.
If the cell to its right is black, 
that's a 1, and so on.
So on the bottom row, we'd write 2.
The next row up we'd write 1,
then 3, then 0.
The pattern then repeats after that.
So this weft is described by the 
sequence 2  1 3 0.
</p>

<figure class="figure ">
  <img src="http://placehold.it/600x400" class="img-rounded center-block" alt="A generic square placeholder image with rounded corners in a figure.">
  <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">
Figure 3: Two drafts. See the text for the
lists that describe them.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Let's now look at the warp in Figure 3a.
Recall the each column of the warp is white
except for one black cell,
so again we only need to know the location
of that cell.
For the warp, we start at the
<strong>right</strong> and work our way
to the left,
and we count from the <strong>top</strong>
and go down.
So if the black cell is in the topmost row,
we'd call it 0.
If it's one down from that,
we'd call it a 1, 
and so on.
The warp pattern in Figure 3a is
then 4 3 2 1 0
which repeats forever
(note that the warp has 5 rows, while
the weft has only 4;
this is perfectly fine).
</p>
<p>
The colors are easy.
For both the warp and the weft,
we simply make a list of the colors
and repeat that list as needed.
Much of the time we'll use a very
simple list with just one color,
so all the thread will be that color.
In Figure 3a,
the list for the weft colors
is just <em>red</em>,
and the list for the warp colors 
is just <em>white</em>.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the tie-up.
Since the tie-up can have any arrangement
of black and while cells,
we just read them off starting at the
top left,
then moving to the right,
and then down a row,
like reading a book.
White cells are 1, and black cells are 0.
So in Figure 3a,
the first row of the tie-up is 0 0 1 1,
the second row is 0 1 1 0,
and so on.
Combining all the rows one after the other
gives us a list of (in this case) 20 
0's and 1's.
TK Replace the numbers above and those in the
list below  with actual values from the figure
</p>
<p>
To summarize, the following list completely
summarizes the draft in Figure 3a,
and thus also completely specifies the pattern
of the fabric it leads to.
If you want to share your draft with other weavers,
this is all you need to give them,
and it's all you need to know from them to
recreate their drafts on your own loom.
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Warp pattern:</strong> TK 0 3 2 1 5 2 </li>
<li><strong>Weft pattern:</strong> TK 0 3 2 1 5 2 </li>
<li><strong>Warp colors:</strong> TK red </li>
<li><strong>Weft colors:</strong> TK yellow blue </li>
<li><strong>Tie-up:</strong> TK 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 </li>
</ul>
<p>
Figure 3b offers another draft.
Try to write down the five lists that
describe the five sections of the draft
before you read the list below:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Warp pattern:</strong> TK 0 3 2 1 5 2 </li>
<li><strong>Weft pattern:</strong> TK 0 3 2 1 5 2 </li>
<li><strong>Warp colors:</strong> TK red </li>
<li><strong>Weft colors:</strong> TK yellow blue </li>
<li><strong>Tie-up:</strong> TK 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 </li>
</ul>
<p>
When we weave the fabric,
we just repeat the warp and weft
patterns and colors as needed.
The tie-up we only have to make once,
but if the input pattern is shorter than
the size of the tie-up grid,
we just use the input pattern over and over until
the grid is filled up,
as in the last example.
</p>
<p>
Now that we know how lists of numbers
let us build a draft,
we'll see how to easily
make big lists of numbers that
lead to beautiful fabrics.
</p>

<h2>The Left Side: AWL Input (and Output)</h2>

<p>
The job of the left side of the window
is to make patterns of numbers and colors.
The problem will use these
to fill in the draft.
</p>
<p>
There are five text input boxes,
one for each of the five sections of the draft.
You can type an expression in a special pattern-making
language into each box,
and then press the arrow to the right of the box
to translate your expression into a list.
The list is immediately copied into the draft
(that is, the grids are updated)
and the fabric is immediately re-woven.
</p>
<p>
It's often useful to see the output of your expressions
so you can make sure you're creating the pattern you want.
At the bottom of the left side there's a region that
holds the output of any one of the five input areas.
Click one of the buttons above to choose which output
you want to see.
When you press one of the arrows,
the output region automatically switches to the 
draft element you just entered.
Note that you can't type into the output area.
</p>
<p>
So what goes into the boxes on the left?
You write little expressions in a custom language
designed for making cool number patterns.
We'll see that language in the next section.
For now, you can just type in a sequence of
numbers (or colors) and then press the arrow.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Important Note</h3> 
If you want to play around with the inputs before
you learn the pattern languages,
try to stick to the following rules.
Your sequences 
for the warp and weft patterns must
be made up only of numbers from 0 to 7, and they must
be separated by spaces (don't use commas
or periods or anything else).
Your sequences for warp and weft colors
must consist only of color names,
separated by spaces 
(for a list of color names, see the section on
<a href="#colors">Colors</a>).
Finally,
the tie-up input should contain just the
two numbers 0 and 1 in whatever sequence you like,
again separated only by spaces.
These rules are just for the moment,
so you can play around with
the inputs before you get to know the pattern language.
</p>

<h1>Making Patterns: The AWL Language</h1>

<p>
A digital loom lets us create large, complicated patterns
in our draft and see their results almost instantly.
You might think that the best way to do this would be
direct interaction: 
just click on the cells of a draft to turn them on and off.
But when patterns become big (like 50 or 200)
elements long, then modifying them by hand becomes
tedious and error-prone.
</p>
<p>
Instead, we use a pattern-making language.
Rather than typing (or clicking) in your pattern,
you type in a short sequence of instructions
that make the pattern for you.
This makes it fast and easy to experiment with big
changes to your draft,
and to explore possibilities by just experimenting
and following your intuition -
or even just messing around at random!
</p>
<p>
Our pattern-making language is called AWL
(Andrew's Weaving Language).
It's loosely based on an undocumented weaving language
that shipped with early versions of the Painter program.
I modified and extended that program to produce AWL.
</p>
<p>
As we've seen, you create your draft by typing
AWL into an input box.
Then you press the arrow for that box,
which converts your AWL into a sequence of numbers
(or colors),
which are then copied into the loom.
The fabric is then automatically updated.
If you want to see the output sequence for any of the
five boxes,
then after you've entered it and pressed the arrow,
choose the corresponding button in the output area
at the bottom of the left side.
Let's now look at the structure of AWL.
</p>
<p>
AWL is a <em>stack-based</em> language.
The traditional way to think about this
is to picture a <strong>stack</strong>
of cafeteria trays,
sitting one on top of the other.
We can write something on each tray:
a number, a string, a list of numbers,
whatever we decide.
We restrict ourselves to only two
operations on this stack:
we can <strong>push</strong> a new
tray onto the top,
or we can <strong>pop</strong> the
topmost tray off the stack.
That's it.
Of course, if we push a tray we no
longer have it in our hands;
it's on the stack.
And if we pop a tray it's no longer
on the stack,
but it's on our hands where we can
read its value and do something with it.
We'll say that if there are no trays,
we have an <strong>empty stack</strong>
(the thinking is that the stack is still
there in an abstract way,
there's just nothing in it).
We'll make the rule that it's illegal
to try to pop the top tray off an empty
stack (since there are no trays to pop).
</p>
<p>
To add 5 and 3 we usually write <code>5+3</code>.
But in a stack-based language,
we write <code>5 3 +</code>.
Let's read this left to right.
We'll treat this as a string of
<em>words</em>, separated by white space.
There are two kinds of words:
<strong>data</strong> and <strong>commands</strong>.
Basically, anything that isn't a command
is presumed to be data.
</p>
<p>
So let's read <code>5 3 +</code>.
We start with an empty stack.
The first word is <code>5</code>.
That's not a command,
we we push it onto the stack,
which now has just one element,
the number 5.
The next word is <code>3</code>.
That's also not a command, so again
we push it.
Now our stack has two items on it:
the number 5 (on the bottom) 
and the number 3 (on the top).
The next word is <code>+</code>.
Aha, that's a command!
And we know it takes two values:
the left and right side of the 
addition symbol.
Since we want two pieces of data,
we'll pop the stack twice.
The first time we pop it,
we get the number 3, since that
was on top.
By convention, we'll treat that as
the data on the right side of the addition
sign, 
so now we're considering the
result of <em>something</em> plus 3.
We pop the stack again,
getting 5,
and that goes on the left side
of our traditional expression <code>5+3</code>.
Note that the stack is now emptyh.
So we evalute our two pieces of data using
the addition command,
getting the result <code>8</code>.
By convention,
all operators push their results back
onto the stack.
Since the stack was empty once we
popped the 5,
when we push the 8 onto the top of the
stack it's now the only element on the stack.
</p>
<p>
That's the basic idea in a nutshell
(see the
<a href="#furtherReading">Further Reading</a>
section if you crave more details).
The calculator example we gave above is
a famous way to illustrate a stack language.
And it's almost right for AWL,
but with a twist.
Our pieces of data are not number,
but <strong>lists</strong>.
They can be lists of number or lists of
colors, but either way they're always lists.
In AWL, 
a list has to have at least one element
(that is, at least one number or color),
but they can be as long as you like.
In fact, much of the power of AWL is that
you can create very big lists with just a
few commands.
Since our lists get turned into the 
checkerboards of the warp, weft, and tie-up
(and the colors for the warp and weft),
having really long lists with lots of
interesting internal patterns can produce
large visual patterns with tons of interesting
structure and detail.
</p>

<h1>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</h1>

<h2>AWL Concepts</h2>
<p>
AWL commands are also called <strong>operators</strong>,
and the data they use are also called <strong>arguments</strong>.
We call any item on a list an <strong>element</strong>,
so in AWL any element is either a number or a color.
All of the elements in any list must be the same,
either all colors or all numbers.
</p>
<h3>Numbers and Lists</h3>
<h3>Lists of Numbers or Colors</h3>

<h3>How To Enter Two Lists In A Row</h3>
<p>
To push a list onto the stack,
you just give its values.
So whether your list has one element
(a number or color), or ten of them,
you just name them all.
As always, 
each list item  must be a single string of
characters with no spaces,
and each element must be 
separated from the others with a space.
</p>
<p>
But what if you want to push two lists
in a row?
Many AWL commands take two lists,
so they expect to pop a list off the stack,
and then another.
Suppose your first list is 
<code>1 2 3</code> and your second is <code>9 8 7 6</code>.
If you typed <code>1 2 3 9 8 7 6</code> into
the input box,
you'd be creating one list with seven elements.
The trick is to call <code>push</code>
between one list and another:
<code>1 2 3 push 9 8 7 6</code> does the trick.
Now the stack holds two new elements
(on top of whatever might have been there before):
one entry with the list <code>1 2 3</code>,
and on top of that (and on top of the stack)
is the list <code>9 8 7 6</code>.
Forgetting to push between two lists is a common
mistake.
You'll often see this kind of thing written
<code>1 2 3 / 9 8 7 6</code> because
<code>/</code> is a shortcut for <code>push</code>.
</p>
<p>
This situation is the pretty much the only 
time you'll ever need to explicitly push something
onto the stack,
because
the rest of the time the system manages all the
pushes for you.
In particular, if you name a list and then
follow it with a command name,
the system will automatically push the list
onto the stack for you.
So if we imagine a command named <code>floop</code>
that takes one list as an argument,
<code>1 2 3 floop</code>
is the same as <code>1 2 3 push floop</code>
or <code>1 2 3 / floop</code>.
Since it's good to keep your AWL as simple
as possible (so it's easy to understand and modify),
I suggest leaving out those extraneous push
commands (in my expressions, I always leave them out).
</p>
<h3>Results Get Pushed Automatically</h3>
<h3>The Domain</h3>
<h3>Automatic Resizing</h3>

<h3>Table Conventions</h3>
<p>
All the commands in the AWL language are
given in a big table below.
Before we get to that,
let's see how to interpret the table entries.
Along the way we'll cover some fundamental
concepts that AWL depends on.
An important convention in the table is that
capital letters <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>
stand for lists,
and lower-case letters
<var>c</var> and <var>d</var>
stand for single numbers
(technically, a single number is a list,
but here we mean to indicate that this
list must have only one element).
Also remember that every command that 
produces a new result will push that result
back onto the stack when it's done.
</p>
<h2>AWL Commands</h2>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<h3>Reverse</h3>
<p>
Let's look at the entry for
<code>reverse</code>.
</p>

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
    <thead>
		<tr>
			<td>Command</td>
			<td>Shortcut</td>
			<td>Wrap</td>
			<td>Resize</td>
			<td>Summary</td>
		</tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
			<td><strong>A</strong> reverse</td>
			<td>@</td>
			<td> </td>
			<td> </td>
			<td>reverse the elements of <strong>A</strong></td>
      </tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>
The first column summarizes the command.
This tells us that the command
<code>reverse</code> takes one
argument: a list.
That means that when the computer
encounters the command <code>reverse</code>,
it will pop one list off the top of the stack
(if the stack is empty, you'll get an error).
The next column tells us that we can just
type the shortcut <code>@</code> instead
of the word <code>reverse</code> if we want.
Let's ignore the next two columns for now.
Finally, the summary tells us that 
the operator reverses the elements of 
<b>A</b>
(and, by convention, pushes the result back onto the stack).
</p>
<p>
For example,
<code>3 4 5 6 reverse</code>
(remember this is the same as
<code>3 4 5 6 push reverse</code>),
will read the <code>3</code>,
push it onto the top of the stack,
then read the <code>4</code> and append
it to the growing list on top of the stack,
and the same for the next two numbers,
so eventually the top of the stack has
the list <code>3 4 5 6</code>.
Now the computer gets the word
<code>reverse</code> which it recognizes
as a command that needs one list.
So it pops the stack,
getting the list <code>3 4 5 6</code>,
and it reverses the elements.
It then pushes the result back onto the stack,
so the stack has the list
<code>6 5 4 3</code> on top.

<h3>Ramp</h3>

Let's look at another command, <code>ramp</code>:

The idea is that we take the 5 and
<em>push</em> it on top of a stack
of numbers (the stack starts out empty),
then we push the 3 on top of that,
and then the + operator 
</em>pops</em> the 3 off the top,
then it pops the 5,
adds them to get 8,
and pushes 8 back onto the top of
of this now-empty stack.
When we're done with an expression,
the stack has one element in it which
holds our result.
Note that sometimes order matters:
"5 10 /" results in 0.5,
while "10 5 /" results in 2.
There is much, much more on stack languages
available on the web and in my papers and
book chapter mentioned at the start of this document.
</p>
<p>
AWL is just a little different than the
calculator example,
because instead of thinking of a single number
as our fundamental object,
AWL thinks of <em>lists</em> as the basic object.
In AWL, lists can be made up of numbers or colors.
For now, we'll stick just to numbers.
</p>
<p>
A list is any list of numbers separated by spaces.
<code>3 4 5</code> is a list.
<code>4</code> is also a list, though a very short one.
As AWL reads each number from your input area,
it appends it to the end of the growing list on the
top of the stack.
This means that if you want to start a new list,
or even just put one number on the stack,
you have to tell AWL that you're done appending
to the current top of the stack.
You can do this easily by saying <code>push</code>.
If you have a growing list on the stack when you 
call </code>push</code>,
AWL pushes a new, blank list on top of the stack.
</p>
<p>
For example,
suppose you want to repeat the sequence <code>5 6 7</code>
a total of <code>3</code> times.
You find the command <code>repeat</code>
which takes two arguments:
first, a list, and second, a number of times to repeat that list.
So the stack should have at least two things on it when you call 
<code>repeat</code>:
the list you want to repeat,
and on top of that,
the number of repeats.
In our example, then, you'd write <code>5 6 7 push 3 repeat</code>,
and you'd get back
<code>5 6 7 5 6 7 5 6 7</code>.
</p>
<p>
Note that this would fail if you left out the <code>push</code>,
writing only <code>5 6 7 3 repeat</code>.
Remember that <code>repeat</code> wants to pop two things
off the stack, and if you wrote this most recent string
you'd just have the list <code>5 6 7 3</code>.
You might argue that <code>repeat</code> should be smart enough
to be able to figure this out and use the last element in
the list as the repeat count,
but it turns out that this is just asking for trouble.
Allowing for this sort of thing just invites a world of errors
and mistakes.
</p>
<p>
So just get in the habit of separating the end of one
list and the start of another 
with <code>push</code>.
</p>
<p>
Like many AWL commands, both 
<code>repeat</code>
and
<code>push</code>
have shortcuts to make typing easier.
<code>repeat</code>
may be written simply as
<code>*</code>
and
<code>push</code>
is abbreviated
<code>/</code>.
So our most recent example could be written
<code>5 6 7 / 3 *</code>.
You can use the full names any time you want to,
of course,
but I suggest getting used to the shortcuts.
You'll get used to seeing idioms that you'll
be using over and over,
and the shorter expression makes it easier to
take it all in at a glance.
</p>

<p>
I mentioned before that AWL supports lists of colors.
These are for the boxes where you create inputs for the
warp and weft colors.
You can refer to a color simply by giving its name,
hex value, or rgb values
(see the section on colors later).
When you're building up a list, AWL treats the colors
just like numbers.
Note, though, that you can't use a color when AWL
is expecting a number.
For example, if you want to repeat the list
<code>green orange</code> three times,
you need to make the second argument the number <code>3</code>,
so it would appear <code>green orange / 3 *</code>.
Trying to repeat the list <code>purple</code> times
wouldn't make any sense, and you'd get an error.
Generally speaking, you can use a color anywhere except
where AWL is explicitly expecting a number.
Like the other lists,
each list of colors gets automatically repeated as many
times as necessary to create your fabric.
</p>

<p>
So you'll write expressions that
produce patterns of numbers for the warp and weft,
patterns of colors for the warp and weft colors,
and patterns of 0's and 1's for the tie-up.
The computer will use your patterns to fill in
the corresponding part of the draft,
and then keep repeating it as needed to make
the entire fabric.
</p>

<p>
AWL has a bit more than 40 commands. I won't run through
them all here.
You can find a discussion of each one in Part 2 of my CG&A
Digital Weaving series,
which again you can read for free by going to my
list of
<a href="http://www.glassner.com/computer-graphics/cga-columns/" target="_blank"">my CG&A columns</a>,
or read in 
<a href="http://www.glassner.com/portfolio/morphs-mallards-and-montages/" target="_blank">my book</a>
that collects those columns.
</p>
<p>
While re-writing AWL for this website, I made a few changes
from the version in those references.
Below is a summary of the AWL commands available to you online,
and below that is a short summary of what's different about
what's here from what was in the columns.
</p>
<p>
In the following,
A and B refer to lists.
The letters c and d refer to single numbers.
Remember that each argument,
whether a list or a number,
must be in its own element on the stack.
A0 and AL refer to the first
and last elements of list A (and B0 and BL do the
same for list B).
Ai refers to the i'th element of A,
and Bi is the same for B.

<h2>Notes on AWL</h2>

<p>
Here are the key differences between what's in 
<a href="http://www.glassner.com/computer-graphics/cga-columns/" target="_blank"">my CG&A columns</a>
and
<a href="http://www.glassner.com/portfolio/morphs-mallards-and-montages/" target="_blank">my book</a>,
and what's implemented here.
</p>

<ul>
<li>domain min clamped to 0. max is >= min+1 </li>
<li>On output, negative warp and weft values are 0</li>
<li><strong>template:</strong> Templates are no longer automatically made relative to the
first number in the second list. So the values you add to each
number in your starting list are simply the numbers you provide.
For example, <code>3 4 : 1 2 3</code> will add the values <code>1 2 3</code>
to <code>3</code> and then to <code>4</code>, producing <code>4 5 6 5 6 7</code>.</li>
<li><strong>updown, updownloop, downup, downuploop:</strong> These four
commands normally reshape the two input lists so they have the same size.
Introduced to the online version, this resizing won't happen if
the first list can have 1 more element than the second one. This way
you can make nice repeating patterns of up and down ramps.
For example, <code>0 1 / 4 updown</code> has two elements in the first
list (<code>0 1</code>)and only one in the second (<code>7</code>).
These lists won't be resized, so the result goes up from <code>0</code>
to <code>4</code>, then back down to <code>1</code>,
giving you the nice up-down sequence <code>0 1 2 3 4 3 2 1</code>.
When this automatically repeats you'll get a nice triangle wave 
repeating forever (a perfect starting point for twills).</li>
<li><strong>twillr, twilll:</strong> These commands got a little 
confused. Here's how they work now.
<ol>
<li>
I implemented them backwards in the original code,
so they rotated in the directions opposite to their names.
That's fixed now (and the examples have been updated
to reflect that).</li>
<li>
Both commands take as input a list <code>A</code>
and two numbers
<code>c</code>
and 
<code>d</code>,
in that order.
The list gets repeated <code>d</code> times.
The first time it appears just as given.
The second time it's rotated right (or left) by <code>c</code>
steps.
The next time that most recent version gets rotated right
(or left) by another <code>c</code> steps, and so on.
So for example,
<code>0 1 2 3 / 1 / 4 twillr</code>
will produce the list
<code>0 1 2 3</code>,
then it gets rotated right once to produce
<code>3 0 1 2</code>,
then rotated again to make
<code>2 3 0 1</code>,
and then a fourth time to produce
<code>1 2 3 0</code>,
giving a final result of
<code>0 1 2 3 3 0 1 2 2 3 0 1 1 2 3 0</code>.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Here are some helpful hints to keep in mind.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Start simple, and add small bits of complexity one step at a time</li>
</li>The output window will always show you what's on top of the stack. Feel free
to ignore the fabric while you experiment with AWL commands and see what they turn into.</li>
<li>Remember to push between lists! This is an easy thing to forget.</li>
<li>Make sure to keep track of your domain. It starts at [0,7] for both warp and
weft, so if you change that, remember your change or set it back to [0,7].</li>
<li>Make sure you have the tie-up sizes set the way you like. The tie-up doesn't
automatically re-size to fit your warp or weft (that would make it much harder
to experiment with your drafts).</li>
<li>When in doubt, just type in your pattern explicitly;
not everything has to be a clever AWL construction.
For example, if you want the pattern <code>0 1 3 5 2</code>,
it's probably easiest to just type that directly into the text area
and move on.</li>
</ul>

<h2>A Worked Example</h2>

<p>
I find that I almost never draw out a draft
before typing it in.
Instead, I start with something simple and
then modify it, following my intution,
as it starts to develop into something interesting.
Here's an exmaple of that process.
</p>

<p>
A nice starting point is a simple twill.
We just put triangle waves in both the warp and weft,
and diagonal stripes in the tie-up.
I'll just pick a couple of constant colors for
both the warp and weft for now.
See Figure 4.
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Warp:</strong> <code>0 1 / 7 updown</code></li>
<li><strong>Weft:</strong> <code>0 1 / 7 updown</code></li>
<li><strong>Warp colors:</strong> <code>LightSeaGreen</code> </li>
<li><strong>Weft colors:</strong> <code>Navy </code></li>
<li><strong>Tie-up:</strong> <code>1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 / 1 / 8 t>></code></li>
</ul>

<p><a name="faq"></a></p>
<h2>FAQ</h2>

<p><strong>Where's + and - etc.?</strong></p>
<p>
TK answer here
</p>
<p><strong>How do I save and load my drafts?</strong></p>
<p>
To <strong>save</strong> a draft, enter the name you want to use in the text box to
the right of the Save button, and then press the Save button.
If a draft of that name already exists, you'll be propted to confirm
you want to over-write it.
The demos at the bottom are built-in and you can't over-write them,
but you can make new versions of your own with the same names.
</p>
<p>
To <strong>load</strong> a draft, just select it from the drop-down list.
</p>
<p>
To <strong>delete</strong> a draft, press the Delete button. It will attempt to delete
the draft named in the text box next to the Save button,
and confirm with you that you really want to delete it.
</p>
<p>
The drafts are not saved as little files, so you don't
need a file extension (like .txt) after their names.
</p>
<p><strong>How do I save my fabric image?</strong></p>
<p>
Right-click on fabric and you should get a pop-up menu. Choose "Save Image As..."
(or whatever is closest to that), and you should get your standard file save
dialog box, letting you put the image anywhere you want. It's saved in PNG
format for best quality; you can turn this into JPG or GIF or anything else
you like with any photo editing program.
</p>
<p><strong>How do I share my drafts?</strong></p>
<p>
Right now, it's a hassle (other questions here go into the reasons).
Until browsers catch up with their aspirations,
here's the best way to save a draft so you can share 
it with someone else.
Open a text editor and make a new, blank file.
Type the words "warp pattern:".
Now click in your browser,
copy the text in the warp pattern input box,
and paste that into the your file.
Still in the text file,
type "weft pattern:",
then click in the browser,
copy the text in the input box for the weft pattern,
and paste that into the text file.
Follow the same thing for the warp and weft colors,
and the tie-up.
At the bottom, type "Tie-up sizes" and type in the values
that you have the tie-up size set to (see the boxes directly
above the fabric).
If you want to save the fabric size,
give that a line in the text file as well.
Now you have a file with the AWL for your draft,
plus the tie-up and fabric sizes.
Save that file.
</p>
<p>
Since that's a normal text file, you can copy it or
back it up or share it or do whatever you like with it.
Unfortunately, 
the program can't read that file,
so to get the information back into the Digital Loom
you need to reverse the process.
Open the file in a text editor,
then one field at a time,
copy the text from the text file (just the AWL expressions,
not your labels - those are just there so you know which is which)
and paste that text into the text boxes.
Then set the tie-up sizes and fabric size if necessary.
Remember you need to press the arrow button to the right
of <em>each</em> input field to 
tell the Digital Loom to read the new AWL you just pasted in.
</p>
<p>
If you want to save the patterns produced by your AWL,
for example to use on a real loom,
you'd follow the same business about creating
a new text file,
and copying data out of the web page and pasting
it into the text file,
only you'd copy the <em>output</em> fields instead.
Those hold the pattern data that you'd then use to
set up a real, physical loom to weave your design.
</p>
<p><strong>Why is all this file stuff so awkward?</strong></p>
<p>
Actually, it's kind of remarkable that we can manage to save and recall anything at all.
The reasons are technical. If you're into that, read on.
If not, just know that someday things ought to get less weird,
but right now this is all we've got.
</p>
<p>
Browsers are very deliberately designed to be unable to talk to your local computer's
hard drive (this is to protect you, and it's one of the reasons the web has succeeded
the way it has). But there are a few little loopholes to that policy. For example, you
probably know about cookies: these are tiny files on your hard drive, written and read
by the browser, that save preferences and other information for web pages. That's an
example of the browser reading from, and writing to, your computer's hard drive.
The Digital Loom doesn't use cookies, but it uses the other two possible exceptions
(these are both perfectly safe: they're part of the offical, international standards 
that all browsers follow in order to work on the web).
</p>
<p>
The first one lets you save your fabric by right-clicking on it and saving it as a picture.
We manage that by telling the browser that the drawing we made is just a normal photograph 
that can be saved in that usual way.
</p>
<p>
The second trick is called LocalStorage, and that's where we store your drafts.
But this is a very constrained way to save things. Each URL (that is, each web page)
can save up to 5MB total, without exception (that's not enough for pictures!).
And each browser manages its own LocalStorage, so the drafts you save on Firefox,
say, will not be available in Chrome, and vice-versa. This is true for each type
of browser. The files are saved to your hard drive, so if you're using a friend's
computer, your saved files will not be there. Finally, these aren't really files at
all, so don't go looking for them on your disk. They're actually saved inside a
database managed by the browser (that's why we can't use this method to save files
you can share with other people (that's why we can't use this method to save files
you can share with other people)).
</p>
<p><strong>Can I save my draft in the WIF weaving-file format to share with other weavers, or use to set up a real loom?</strong></p>
<p>
Oh, how I wish the answer was "yes", but it's not. In fact, I have written all
the code to support reading and writing WIF files.
But that's useless now,
because browsers are forbidden from writing files to your
local file system. 
This means the browser can't write a WIF file to your disk.
There are a few ways to save files, but all the ones I know of have major drawbacks:
you can run a local server, but that's a technical task that most people are not prepared to do;
you can use a commercial remote server, but that means either you or I pay money to buy space;
or
you can use a free remote server, but all the ones I've looked into require a prohibitive amount
of time and work from me to support.
When browsers finally allow us to read and write to 
carefully blocked-off parts of your local file system,
as the current international spec calls upon them to do,
then I'll very happily change the draft saving and loading 
to use WIF files by defaultt.
</p>
<p><strong>Why am I getting a really weird error when my AWL looks fine?</strong></p>
<p>
A very frequent cause of weird errors is messing up the spacing rule.
Remember that each <em>word</em> in AWL must be surrounded by space.
That means each number and each command.
For example, the shortcut for <code>twillr</code> is <code>t>></code>,
all one word with no spaces.
And if you want to concatenate three lists together,
you'd write <code>, , ,</code> with a space between each comma.
Leaving out those spaces, or including extra ones where they don't belong,
is an easy mistake to make.
</p>
<p><strong>How do I debug my AWL?</strong></p>
<p>
If things are going wrong, I find it easiest to write down the whole
expression I'm working on, and then build it up again one step at a time.
Type in one new piece of stuff to build the pattern, hit the button,
and see what's on top of the stack. If that looks right, continue.
If it doesn't, tune up what you have there until it does.
</p>
<p><strong>You said there should be just one thing left on the stack at the end, but I have more. Is that a problem?</strong></p>
<p>
Not necessarily, if what's on top is the result you want. But usually that indicates a problem. A common cause of this comes from building up your expression in pieces, but then forgetting to concatenate them together into one big pattern when you're done. A lot of complicated expressions end with a bunch of commas (the concatenation shortcut) to glue together all the intermediate results sitting on the stack.
</p>
<p><strong>AWL isn't much of a language. Where are the variables, loops, procedures, etc.?</strong></p>
<p>
AWL isn't a general-purpose programming language, and it doesn't need all that stuff.
It's been designed for one thing only: to help you make cool patterns of numbers
and colors that are useful in weaving. You don't need variables, loops, and all that
stuff to do that.
If you find yourself wanting to use all of those tools to make your expressions,
your best bet is to fire up your favorite language and write programs in it.
The output should be either a big list of numbers or colors,
which you can just copy and paste into the appropriate input box.
Hit the arrow and it will simply copy over into the output box.
Or, if you're feeling fancy, you can use your program to write AWL expressions
that you copy and paste the same way.
</p>
<p><strong>Hey! You crashed my browser!</strong></p>
<p>Sorry! 
The truth is that there are a lot of ways that things can go
wrong when we turn your AWL into a pattern.
I've tried to catch all of them,
and to give you at least some information about where things
went wrong.
If something slipped past me and crashed your browser,
I'd love to fix it.
The catch is that I'd need the <em>exact</em> AWL expression you
were trying to translate at the time of the crash,
and that's probably gone because,
well,
the browser's crashed.
So if you can,
try to immediately re-load the page and recreate the problem.
Copy the text in your input box frequently each time you get
closer to the problem.
Then when it does crash,
you'll be able to send me email and simply paste the
offending AWL right into the body of the mail.
